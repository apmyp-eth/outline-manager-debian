# Simple desktop entry installer for Outline Manager

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apmyp-eth/outline-manager-debian.git
cd outline-manager-debian/
./install.sh 
```

## What it does

* downloads Outline Manager from official site (never trust, check install.sh)
* installs it to ~/Apps
* install icons and .dekstop file
* refreshes icons cache

## Why

Tired to make this manually on every fresh install.
